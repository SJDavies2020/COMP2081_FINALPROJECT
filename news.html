        <h4> Cafe Feminino</h4><br>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/1.jpg" height="260" width="270" /></div><br>
        <p>If you order a coffee at the Lazy Tulip Cafe we will free pour our fair trade & organic, Planet Bean medium
          roast coffee called Cafe Feminino. This coffee is bringing women together all over the world and we love it!
        </p>
        <p>Guelph’s Planet Bean Coffee imports and roasts Café Feminino Fairtrade Organic coffee which is an initiative
          of some of the poorest women in Peru. It involves them growing their own coffee, keeping it separate from
          other
          coffee and keeping the revenue generated through its sale in their own hands. This initiative has empowered
          these women in Peru where men would normally control the household income. You will find the the Femenino
          movement is now worldwide with over 750 women involved in 50 communities.</p>

        <h4>THE NEW TULIP <br> <em>Giving Thanks</em></h4><br>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/2.jpg" height="260" width="270" /></div><br>
        <p>Over the last five years the Lazy Tulip Cafe has organically grown our business allowing us to take over the
          unit next door which was previously set up as a hair salon. Over the years the salon shuffled hands a few
          times & during that shuffle I was always offered by the owner the opportunity to take it over but I had never
          felt ready until now.</p>

        <p>On October 1st, 2016 I signed the lease for the new space then everything just happened to fall nicely into
          place. One of my customers recommended a contractor, Speare Contracting. Shawn quickly showed up at the café
          to check out the job and he just had an air about him that was trusting and seemed prideful of his work. There
          was an immediate comfort level there. At the next meeting Rick Speare also came to meet with me and it was a
          done deal. No need to look any further for contractors even though it was suggested I get multiple quotes.
          These guys seemed honest and I felt comfortable. I always follow my heart & that’s how I roll.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h4>The former hair salon</h4><br>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/3.jpg" height="260" width="270" /></div><br>
        <p>Rick & Shawn then suggested I work with a local architect, Rob Jeffries to get my drawings done. Rob’s office
          is located at the corner of Dunlop & Maple Avenue…. literally a stone’s throw from the café so again…done
          deal. Rob, with the help of Rob Mitchell were able to efficiently get my plans together for me.</p>

        <p>As the City of Barrie’s Department of Planning & Building Services is pretty backed up they suggested that I
          get a “Conditional Permit” which allowed me to get the project started. In order to do so we had to have an
          authorized architect who would oversee the renovations on the city’s behalf. We were lucky to have Rob
          Mitchell in our court allowing us to move quickly & efficiently.</p>

        <h4>Demolition</h4><br>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/4.jpg" height="260" width="270" /></div><br>
        <p>The demolition only took a couple of days as they ripped out mirrors, glass and partitions with remnants of
          hair dye & extensions. Once the floors & walls were patched and sanded our good friend & master painter Bobby
          Hatcher came in from Hamilton to give us a hand with Randy Aylwin by his right hand side. In a day the new
          colours were up and the space started to take shape!</p>

        <h4>Madd Moll Wall Mural <br> <em>Phase 2</em></h4><br>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/5.jpg" height="260" width="270" /></div><br>
        <p> Next Molly Aylwin, otherwise known as Madd Moll came up from Toronto to start the first phase of the wall
          mural. Brother Keenan was also there to help out as the Aylwins made it a family affair. In just a few hours
          the centerpiece of the room was finished and Molly nailed it. This girl never ceases to amaze me with how her
          creative brilliance comes to her with such ease. Over the Christmas holidays Molly was able to take the mural
          to Phase II adding more flowers, mandalas and a turquoise OM. Pure brilliance! </p>

        <h4> Benson Wellington</h4><br>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/6.jpg" height="260" width="270" /></div><br>
        <p>The bench was Pinterest inspired with the frame & barn board backing built by Mike at Benson Wellington.
          Again
          the backing is reclaimed barn board that he lightly sanded down and finished. The bottom was basically just a
          wooden frame with a plywood front. I had sourced out some burlap coffee sacks from Planet Bean coffee from the
          actual coffee suppliers. With these I was able to put together the bench cushions that sat on top of the
          frame.

        <h2> Love & Hugs, Michelle Huggins</h2><br>
        <p>During all of this was the kitchen reno which was the most stressful and trying of them all. In order for us
          to remain open during all of this we had to pack up the kitchen every night then get in early the next morning
          to clean and set everything back up. However, the expanded space which we acquired by removing one bathroom
          was urgently needed in order to accommodate the extra seats! As a part of this kitchen reno was the need for
          more power! Thank you to Georgian Electric for being so accommodating and giving us a boost!
        </p>
        <p>The next step in evolving our kitchen was the involvement of a culinary consultant. The first person that
          came
          to mind for me was my good friend Av Atikian. Av was the former chef at the Rosedale Diner for many years then
          opened up Jam Café in Toronto’s Cabbagetown. Now he’s taken on the role as a culinary consultant and was able
          to
          offer us up some much needed guidance on taking our kitchen to the next level!</p>

        <p>Today our new space brings with it a sense of calm. I find that our customers are able to relax and take
          their
          time enjoying the experience. There is more space and more light allowing each person a chance to take it all
          in.

          I just wanted to personally thank everyone who helped to make this project happen. Without everyone’s help &
          love this space would not have the beautiful, new energy it has today!</p>
